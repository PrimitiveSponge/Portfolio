        <h1>Tennis</h1>
        I play lots of tennis and train hard so I can make it on the High School team. It is very fun and is one of my favorite <br>
        things to do. It is good to play a sport so you gain some skill and exercise. It gives me something to do so I'm <br>
        not always so bored at home. I have made friends and have done tournaments doing thid. It is something that I love <br>
        and it is good to play a sport because you gain these benifits.
